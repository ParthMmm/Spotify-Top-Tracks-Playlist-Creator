# About

The last.py script uses last.fm's API to retrieve a user's top 30 most played songs in the chosen time period. The songs are then written to a text file, output.txt. playlist.py then parses each line in the text file to get the artist and track title. Using spotipy, a Python library for the Spotify API, each track is added to a new playlist in the user's profile.

# Instructions

1. Add API_KEY and API_SECRET from Last.FM
2. Add CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from Spotify.
3. python3 last.py
4. python3 playlist.py
5. Enjoy your new playlist!
